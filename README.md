# Bloomington Animal Care & Control Data - Project Introduction

Bloomington Animal Care and Control data is available from the Bloomington city governmentâ€™s data portal, BClear. The Animal Care and Control Division has prepared two data sets that the public may use to understand how the city handles animal welfare:

* Annual Statistics (2004-2019) - these data represent high level annual statistics for the division, which includes revenue, budgets, staffing, counts of animal intakes and movements;
* Adoptions (2018-Present) - these data represent animal intake, adoption, and control records maintained by the division. This is a complex, messy data set that tracks individual stories of animals taken in by the city.

This team will be working with both data sets. This notebook will provide a description of each data set, and any data processing that will facilitate analysis and visualization by team members that can be updated, re-used, and shared with others!

The Annual Statistics data is great for those interested in practicing some basic implementing data visualizations with a tidy data set.

The Adoptions data set is much larger and complex than the annual statistics, with over 12,000 intake records. The table is a roll-up of an internal data base, and includes both redundant data and some potentially misleading fields.

## Data Visualization Ideas

Example analysis and visualizations might include:

* Description of each animal's time with the Animal Care and Control,
* Descriptive, temporal, and other exploratory analysis of species managed by the division.
   * Identify the kinds of animals that are brought into the shelter and why;
   * Identify trends of intakes, returns, adoptions, fosters, and euthanization...
      * by species and breed, age groups, or intake and return reasons or movement types
* Visualize pathways through the shelter by animals
* Model animal outcomes
